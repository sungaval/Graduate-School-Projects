# Consulting Project
I colaborated with Sandra Robles Muñoz to consult a professor asking about vilitigo disease. The two questinos posed were 

Q1: Are the disease susceptibility variants individually, or as a risk score, associated with disease characteristics?

Q2: What effect sizes for disease characteristics are detectable with greater than or equal to 80% power without adjustment for multiple testing, with adjust for the number of tests in Q1, and with adjustment genome-wide?
