  This is a project that I worked on with Eric Olberding on Separable Convex Cost Network Flow Problems. We give details about what Separable Convex Cost Network Flow Problems are, where can these problems arise in the real world, and how can they be transformed so they can be solved easier. Here is a wiki page Eric and I created for the project http://math.ucdenver.edu/~sborgwardt/wiki/index.php/Separable_Convex_Cost_Network_Flow_Problems.
