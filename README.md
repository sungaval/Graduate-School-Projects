# Graduate-School-Projects
These are all of the projects I created while in graduate school for Masters in Economics and a Masters in Statistics. Each folder contains the project for each class and small descriptions about the projects. The projects presented are unedited from the original submissions for a grade. More theoretical material in Statistics and Economics is not reflected in these projects. I am glad to discuss my results on any of my projects with anybody.
