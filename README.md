# Graduate-School-Projects
These are all of the projects I created while in graduate school for Masters in Economics and a Masters in Statistics. Below is a list of the class and a small description for the project. The projects presented are unedited from the original submissions for a grade. More theoretical material in Statistics and Economics is not reflected in these projects. I am glad to discuss my results on any of my projects with anybody.
