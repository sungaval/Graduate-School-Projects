# Masters Project for Statistics - Exploring Gao et al. as a method for finding the effective number of independent tests in metabolomic data
For this project I use Gao et al. method usually used for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) data to see if the method works well at finding the effective number of independent tests in metabalomics data.
